# WorkSpace-Optimization
Data Management Project


Business Problem –
In this present pandemic affected world in which the software industry like
Infosys plays a major role, employees often prefer to choose to work from home
rather attending the office in person due to the visibly profitable perks. Offices
are paying more than the required amount for the unused spaces in the
workspace, and this is proving to be a major burnout for the company. In order to
overcome this, our project “Workspace Management” might help to reduce the
charges and allot proper required space for the employees to be placed in
appropriate places on their workday.
The development of this new system tries to automate the entire process keeping
in the view of database integration approach.
It’s more like allotted workspace is making a contact with the employee about the
availability of space at office, so that the employee can reserve their worktable
for their required time slot based on their choice. This saves the time of the
employee and company's utility charges.


Executive Summary -

The primary objective of this study is to design and implement a relational database that can be
useful to the IT industry for those who often prefer to work from home rather than attending in
person. Given the covid phase work from home has become a new normal and all the employees
now prefer to work in comfort of home. Companies paying lot for leasing will have an added
advantage as they can now pay lesser than before by only taking up small spaces. This
application might help to reduce the charges and allot proper required space for the employees.
The development of this new system tries to automate the entire process keeping in the view of
database integration approach. It’s more like allotted workspace itself making a contact with the
employee about the availability of tables at workspace, so that the employee can block their
worktable for their required time slot based on their choice.
Employees typically prefer to work from home rather than go to the workplace in person in
today's pandemic-affected globe, where the software business, such as Infosys, plays a key role,
due to the clearly economic rewards. Offices are spending more than the needed amount for idle
working spaces, which is causing serious burnout in the organization. To address this, our project
"Office Space Optimization" may be able to assist cut costs by allocating adequate space for
employees to be put in appropriate locations throughout their workday.
It's more like allocated workspace is informing the employee about the availability of office
space so that the employee may reserve their work schedule for the time slot of their choice. This
saves both the employee's time and the company's utility costs.In implementing this database, the
following rules must be followed:
1. The admin is responsible for managing the addition of a company to the portal and to
manage its workspace area.
2. Each user can book the cubicle or conference hall for desired amount of time.
3. Each company must register themselves in the portal by sending in request form on the
portal.
4. Building table has the data of the leases or the owned buildings of the companies.
5. Each user can only have one account which is by their company email ID only.
6. The booking details are stored along with the time duration and booking ID.
7. The database also must update the allotted cubicles/ Conference halls which are already
taken and should update the new available timings. 
8. One user can have multiple bookings.

The database was created by considering all the information that is required to build a model for
a user to be able to access workspace and do their necessary bookings. Data used to populate the
tables was generated from mockaroo. These conceptual data was transferred to a relational model
to populate the tables with the data using EER and UML diagrams. Primary and foreign key
constraints were specified across the relational model, and database implementation in MySQL
was shown utilizing all the tables. Neo4j database is queried using Cypher with 4 nodes available
to provide an illustration of No SQL database.
